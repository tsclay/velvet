# Velvet

Velvet is a library of friendly, streamlined utility components for the Svelte framework.

#### What is Svelte?

Basically, it is a framework for writing performant UI without using a virtual DOM. Svelte is a compiler. Write your Svelte code and watch it become pure Javascript.

## Component Library

#### Nav Bar

What you get:

- Sticky nav that sticks to the top of the page, even if following a hero/banner header.
- Flex-box styling to distinguish logo from nav-links
- Links become a menu toggled by a hamburger button at smaller widths
  - 600px is the default, but this can be changed

#### Dropdown Selector

#### Hero Grid
